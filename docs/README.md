# TizenBrew

Welcome to TizenBrew! TizenBrew is a way to experience modded websites (like [TizenTube](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenTube)) and you can install newer apps without having to deal with Tizen Studio multiple times.

TizenBrew is a modular system, meaning you can install new modded websites and apps without having to mess with Tizen Studio.

## Installation

To install TizenBrew, you need to have a Samsung TV (Tizen) device that has at least Tizen 3.0 (2017 or newer). There are four ways to install TizenBrew.

### PREFERRED: Using TizenBrew Installer

This is the easiest method and works on every Samsung TV released since 2017.

#### 1. Set the Host PC IP Address to `127.0.0.1`
1. Open **Apps** or **App Settings** on your Samsung TV.
2. In the **Apps** panel, enter `12345` using your remote control or the on-screen keypad.
3. A *Developer Mode* configuration popup will appear:
   - Switch **Developer mode** to **On**.
   - Under **Host PC IP**, enter `127.0.0.1`.
4. Click **OK**.
5. Reboot your TV.

For more details, see [Step 1 here under “Connecting the TV and SDK”](https://developer.samsung.com/smarttv/develop/getting-started/using-sdk/tv-device.html#Connecting-the-TV-and-SDK).

#### 2. Install TizenBrew Installer from a USB Drive
1. Download the [latest `userwidget.zip` file](https://github.com/reisxd/TizenBrewInstaller/releases/latest) from the TizenBrewInstaller repository.
2. Extract `userwidget.zip` to the **root** of your USB drive.  
   Example: If your USB is drive **D:**, the path should look like:  
`D:/userwidget/app.tmg`
3. Insert the USB drive into your Samsung TV.  
The TV will automatically install the demo version of TizenBrew Installer and display a notification when the app is installing.

#### 3. Install the Full Version
1. Launch **TizenBrew Installer** on your TV.
2. Click **Install TizenBrew** to upgrade to the full version.

> **Note:** If you're on **Tizen 7 or above**, you’ll be prompted to sign in to your Samsung account. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a Samsung certificate.
